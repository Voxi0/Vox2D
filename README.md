# Vox2D
Simple 2D Minecraft Like Game made with Python and Ursina.

# Help
You could read all the issues and fix or implement a solution for those issues. Just install Ursina for Python using -

  pip install ursina
  
And you can use your favourite code editor to edit the source code. I personally prefer and recommend VSCode.

# Status
I stopped working on this project because I can't solve the issues and the project doesn't seem worth it to spend much time on. You can still contribute to the project if you like.
