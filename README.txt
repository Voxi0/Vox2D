This is a 2D clone of Minecraft I made with Python 3.10.7 and the Ursina Game Engine.
I have used OOP concept to make things more organized and easier to manage. I built
the foundation(Building System, Camera, Blocks) etc.

Controls:
 	Player -
		Middle Mouse Button = Spawn Player (Always Spawn One)
		WASD = Move Player (Red Cube)
		Space = Jump

	Building -
		Up Arrow or 8 on Numpad = Place Block Above Block Cursor is Pointing At
		Down Arrow or 2 on Numpad = Place Block Below Block Cursor is Pointing At

		Right Arrow or 6 on Numpad = Place Block to the Right Side of the Block Cursor is Pointing At
		Left Arrow or 4 on Numpad = Place Block to the Left Side of the Block Cursor is Pointing At

		Press RMB to Delete Block That The Mouse Cursor is Pointing At

	Camera -
		Press + to Zoom In
		Press - to Zoom Out


There is only one block in the world by default. You can just create new blocks to make your own map
to your liking by following the controls.
